*About me*

I grew up in Oakland, California and am currently living in Los Angeles for school. After graduation, I will be moving to Madison, Wisconsin to work for Epic Healthcare Systems in Verona, WI.

Outside of school, I enjoy seeing live music and exploring LA's many cafes and restaurants. My favorite restaurant in LA is Messob on Fairfax, as I have loved Ethiopian food since childhood, and I also enjoy the Alcove in Los Feliz or Layla's Bagels in Santa Monica for brunch.
